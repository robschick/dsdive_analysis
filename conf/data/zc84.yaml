    Deep dives (dives over 1,000m) from zc84.  Dives are stored in separate
    files, but observations are timestamped so that the dataset could support
    sequential modeling.  However, the dataset does not contain all deep dives
    from zc84; the dataset only includes deep dives that meet certain quality
    standards.  The dives are also preprocessed so that the observations all use
    the same exact depth bins.
