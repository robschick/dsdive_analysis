  description: Deep dives (dives over 800m) from zc84.  Dives are additionally filtered
    such that they begin and end in a surface bin.  Dives are stored in separate files,
    but observations are timestamped so that the dataset could support sequential
    modeling.  The dives are preprocessed so that the observations all use the same
    exact depth bins.  Depth bins are reported once every 300 seconds.
