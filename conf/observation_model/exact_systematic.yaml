  description: |
    Dives are observed according to a systematic sampling design.  Observations
    are made at times t_i = t0 + eps + (i-1) * dt, where the dive begins at
    t0 = 0, eps is a constant, and dt is the time between
    observations.  Observations at times before t0 are ignored, and the offset
    eps is assumed to be 0.
