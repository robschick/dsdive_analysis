  description: |
    Dives are observed according to a systematic sampling design.  Observations
    are made at times t_i = t0 + eps + (i-1) * dt, where the dive begins at
    t0 = 0, eps = 2 * tstep * B - tstep where B ~ Beta(a,b), and dt is the time
    between observations.  Observations at times before t0 are ignored, and the
    offset eps is unknown.  The distribution for eps is a scaled and shifted
    beta distribution.  A similar assumption is made for the end of the dive,
    tf.
