  description: Use the 85% rule to estimate prior parameters for stage
    transition times from data.  Set priors for descent and ascent speeds from
    Tyack (2006), Table 2, and infer prior for forage speed from same paper.
    The prior distribution for forage_speed has been selected such that the
    prior distribution is unimodal with a bounded density at all points.
