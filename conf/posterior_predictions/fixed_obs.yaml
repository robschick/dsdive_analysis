    Start posterior prec... the issue is really how we observe the posterior
    posterior predictions.  Since these are fast to simulate, we don't need to
    worry about overwriting the simulations.  Instead, we are more concerned
    with using different observation schemes to observe the same dives.  So, we
    might consider drawing one set of posterior predictions, and then reusing
    these under different observation schemes.
